This is the README file for Garn. A python package that facilitates
effective mass calculations of contact geomety dependence on
transmission.

`Kwant <https://kwant-project.org>`_ is used for calculations. 

The documentation of the software can be found in the "docs/html_docs"
directory. Start by opening the "index.html" file. The documentation
is also avalible through `this website
<http://web.comhem.se/emil.sweden/html_docs/index.html>`_ .

A formal introduction can be found throuhg the bachelor thesis
`Numerical simulations of contact geometry effects on transport
properties of semiconductor nanowires
<http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/8878322>`_.


Installation
------------
If not allready installed install `Kwant <https://kwant-project.org>`_. 

To install Garn simply copy the "/garn" folder to somewere in your
