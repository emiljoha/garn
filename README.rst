This is the README file for Garn. A python package that facilitates
effective mass calculations of contact geomety dependence on
transmission.

`Kwant <https://kwant-project.org>`_ is used for calculations. 

The most up to date documentation of the software can be found in the
"doc/build/html" directory. Start by opening the "start_here.html"
file. The documentation is also avalible through `this website
<http://web.comhem.se/emil.sweden/html_docs/index.html>`_ .

A formal introduction can be found throuhg the bachelor thesis
`Numerical simulations of contact geometry effects on transport
properties of semiconductor nanowires
<http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/8878322>`_.


Installation
------------
If not allready installed, install `Kwant <https://kwant-project.org>`_. 

To install Garn simply copy /garn folder to somewere in your
sys.path. No need for compiling.
